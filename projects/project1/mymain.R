# Instructions
# Code: Your R/Python script should be in a singular file named either mymain.R or mymain.py.
# This script should:
#   – Accept train.csv and test.csv as inputs.
# – Generate two submission files based on the specified format (detailed below).
# – Important: Do not submit ZIP files or markdown/notebook files.
# The structure of your mymain.R (or mymain.py) should adhere to the following:
#   – Step 0: Load necessary R libraries or Python packages
# – Step 1: Preprocess the training data, then fit the two models.
# ∗ Note: At this step, you are strictly not allowed to access the test data.
# – Step 2: Preprocess test data, then save predictions into two files: mysubmission1.txt and
# mysubmission2.txt. (The specific format for these files is detailed below.)
# ∗ Note: At this step, you are strictly not allowed to access the training data

clean_data = function(in_df) { 
  # in_df - dataframe matching format of Ames housing dataset
  # note that this function must work with dataframes but including and excluding the 
  # column Sale_Price
  
  #TODO: Implement me! 
  out_df = in_df
  
  return(out_df)
  }
