## Overview

## Section 1: Technical Details

Data Pre-processing:

    The project involves sentiment analysis on text data.
    We utilized a custom vocabulary loaded from the 'myvocab.txt' file.
    The data underwent pre-processing steps:
        Removal of HTML tags from the 'review' column in both training and test datasets.
        Tokenization and lowercasing of text using the itoken function with the text2vec package.
        Creation of document-term matrices (DTM) using the custom vocabulary and n-gram range of 1 to 4.

Model Implementation:

    We employed Lasso regression via the cv.glmnet function from the 'glmnet' package for binary classification.
    Model training was performed on the training data with the 'binomial' family and evaluated based on the AUC (Area Under Curve) metric.
    
## Section 2: Performance Metrics

The computer system this was run on was a Dell Inspiron 3501, 1.00 GHz with 8.00 GB of installed RAM for all 5 splits. Below is a summary of the split #, the AUC score, and the time (in seconds) it took to train and evaluate each split:

        
| Split	| AUC               | Time (s)          |
