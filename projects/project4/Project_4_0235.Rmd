```{r setup, eval = TRUE}
# add required packages
packages = c('')

# if packages don't exist, install. Then call library on them
for (package in packages) {
  if (!requireNamespace(package, quietly=TRUE)) {
    install.packages(package)

# System I: Recommendation Based on Genres

We propose the following genre-based recommendation system. A human-readable description of the system is provided first, with implementation in r below. This section of the report generates a csv file that will be used directly by the application to make recommendation.


## Considerations
Goals 
Show users movies that are good
Get more reviews 


1. Recommend 'good' movies. Define good 

2. Add in some highly rated by not very well reviewed movies

3. Add in a small number of not very well reviewed movies 


## Limitations
Algorithm implemented without feedback
Algorithm is static

In real world setting, would try to get additional reviews from users. Would recalculate recommendations each time so that users see new recommendations. A good strategy might be: once a user 'selects' a movie, to replace it with a new recommendation, or provide some kind of shuffle button for the user to reset recommendations. 

# Implementation 
```{r system1, eval = TRUE}
```

# System II: Recommendation Based on IBCF

```{r system2, eval = TRUE}
```
